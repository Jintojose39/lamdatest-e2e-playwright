# ðŸ’¼ E-Commerce Application E2E Testing using Playwright

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end (E2E) testing flow for an e-commerce application using Playwright Test Runner. It follows best practices with the Page Object Model (POM), JSON-based test data, CI with GitHub Actions, Allure and HTML reporting, and test summary email notifications via Mailtrap.

## ðŸ”„ GitHub Actions CI Workflow

CI is triggered on every push or pull request to `main`/`master` branches.

### Workflow Steps:

* âœ… Setup job
* âœ… Checkout code
* âœ… Setup Node.js & Playwright Browsers
* âœ… Install dependencies
* âœ… Clean previous Allure results
* âœ… Run Playwright tests with Allure & HTML reporters
* âœ… Install Allure CLI
* âœ… Generate Allure Report
* âœ… Zip Playwright HTML Report
* âœ… Upload both reports as GitHub artifacts
* âœ… Send Mailtrap email with report summary

> Average Run Time: \~3 minutes

## ðŸ“Š Test Reporting

### âœ… Allure Report

* Provides detailed insights with labels, timelines, features
* Annotations added in test code for better tracking
* Generated by CLI:

```bash
npx allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
npx allure open allure-report
```

### âœ… Playwright HTML Report

* Auto-generated via Playwright
* Can be opened locally:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Access Reports in CI:

* Download artifacts from GitHub Actions run summary
